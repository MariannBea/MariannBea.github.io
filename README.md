## ðŸš€ About Me
I am currently working towards a degree in Computer Science with Data Analytics. I previously worked in education and have taught in schools in The United States, Germany, South Korea and China. In addition to English, I can speak German and survival Chinese. I am particularly interested in education, politics and social justice issues.
